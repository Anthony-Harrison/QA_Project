# QA_Project
o	Why are we doing this?

This is my final project for the QA software development bootcamp. This is to showcase my skills gained during my time at the bootcamp. I have used Jira to organise my project and a risk assesment to identify areas of concern. Then Java with springboot to build a REST API with test driven development using unit and intergration tests and also using postman as no frontend was developed during this project.


o	How I expected the challenge to go.

I expected to set the Jira board up do a risk assesment, then just write the base Java code to run test it with postman and junit/mokito then modify it to use DTOs and present data in a more acceptable manner.

o	What went well? / What didn't go as planned?

Things that went well were setting up the Jira board, risk assesment and the initial code structure with tests.

Implementing the DTOs proved to be far more challenging than I thought and tweaking my code to show the desired outcome proved difficult. 

In the end I gave myself far more work than I could do. Partly because I vastly underestimated the amount of time each step took. 

o	Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.

Far smaller scope to start with. 

Doing 4 things at the same time instead of just the 2 required caused me to rush my work and overall produced lower quality work.

o	Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.

o	Screenshots of your database to prove that data is being persisted.

o	Screenshot of your test results, including coverage report.
